# @sap/ux-cds-compiler-facade

The SAP Fiori Tools - CDS Compiler Facade is a wrapper module for CAP CDS compiler. It contains a set of specific APIs needed for annotation handling in CAP CDS projects.

Compiler facade provides various API methods that allows the user to extract data from the CAP CDS compile model such as metadata, annotation index, compiler messages, annotation propagation map and others (see usage example below) in a compiler version agnostic way.

It supports all the officially supported CAP CDS compiler versions.

## Status

[![Main Build Status](https://gkeuxtoolssuite.jaas-gcp.cloud.sap.corp/buildStatus/icon?job=ux-engineering%2Fcds-compiler-facade%2Fmain)](https://gkeuxtoolssuite.jaas-gcp.cloud.sap.corp/job/ux-engineering/job/cds-compiler-facade/job/main/)

## Installation (as a consumer)

Npm
`npm install --save @sap/ux-cds-compiler-facade`

Yarn
`yarn add @sap/ux-cds-compiler-facade`

Pnpm
`pnpm add @sap/ux-cds-compiler-facade`

## Usage

Create compiler facade object from existing CDS compile model.

```Typescript
    const cdsCompilerFacade = await createCdsCompilerFacade(compileModel);

    const uris = cdsCompilerFacade.getAllSourceUris();

```

If you don't have CDS compile model available, you can compile the project files and obtain compiler facade.

```Typescript
import { getCdsFiles } from '@sap-ux/project-access';
import { createCdsCompilerFacadeForRoot } from '@sap/ux-cds-compiler-facade';

const root = projectRootFolder;
const files = await getCdsFiles(root);
const cdsCompilerFacade = createCdsCompilerFacadeForRoot(root, files);

// Use of facade methods and properties
const metadata = cdsCompilerFacade.getMetadata('myService');
const errors = cdsCompilerFacade.getCompilerErrors();

```
