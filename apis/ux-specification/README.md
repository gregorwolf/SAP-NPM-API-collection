# @sap/ux-specification

This package specifies the structure of SAP Fiori elements templates in form of typescript types and JSON schema files. You can find the JSON schemas under dist/schema.
This package is used by SAP Fiori tools (see documentation link below) but can also be used independently of this application.

Each major version of this specification package corresponds to one or more major versions of SAPUI5. A new major version is usually set up for each SAPUI5 version that has a long-term maintenance. The major versions of @sap/ux-specification differ in the scope of supported properties and capabilities, in analogy with the SAP Fiori elements' capabilities of the SAPUI5 major version.
The relevant SAPUI5 versions of a specification version are linked by tags.

The module supports both the OData V2 and the OData V4 version of the templates (aka FioriElementsVersion), so you can find two different access points for the typescript definitions:

- src/v2.ts comprises the OData V2 definitions
- src/v4.ts comprises the OData V4 definitions

(Generic) JSON schemas are generated from the typescript definitions for the following schema types (enum TemplateType):

- FioriElementsVersion.v2:  Application, ObjectPage, ListReport, AnalyticalListPage and OverviewPage
- FioriElementsVersion.v4:  Application, ObjectPage, ListReport, AnalyticalListPage and FreestylePage

You can retrieve any generic schema via schemaAccess.ts.

Besides the type definitions and schemas, src/api.(d.)ts provides functions that can be used by SAP Fiori apps in connection with the JSON schemas:

- generateSchema: converts one generic schema to an application specific one, enriched by app-specific information such as the annotations (as far as they are relevant for setting up the schematic view of the app, for instance collections like facets, columns, actions).
- importConfig: imports information from the app, like manifest settings or SAPUI5 flexibility changes, into one JSON configuration file that relates to a given schema (representing the central settings of the app or of a page of the app).
- exportConfig: exports from one JSON configuration file, returning an updated manifest.json file and a complete list of all current SAPUI5 flexibility changes and view or fragments.
- exportConfigEntityByPath: exports a single property or section from the given config.json that is specified by a path expression, returns only the updated artifacts. Supported for List Report, Object Page and Analytical List Page.
- deleteConfigEntityByPath: deletes a single property or section from the given config.json that is specified by a path expression. Supported for List Report, Object Page and Analytical List Page.
- importProject: imports information from the app and generates all schemas and JSON configuration files.
- importProjectSchema: imports information from the app and generates all schemas but no JSON configuration files.
- getApiVersion: returns the given API version. The API version starts with 1 and will be increased in case of incompatible changes to which the consumption layer must react.
- generateCustomExtension: generates custom extensions, e.g. custom pages, custom Columns etc. for a V4 application by using the `@sap-ux/fe-fpm-writer`.

When calling any API function you may pass a logger instance for collecting any messages. The interface of your logger must fit to the ExtensionLogger definition. If no logger is passed, the output channel for messages is the console.

## Constraints

The API functions do not modify any OData annotations.
