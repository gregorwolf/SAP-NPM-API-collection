# @sap/open.fe
[SAP Fiori elements](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/03265b0408e2432c9571d6b3feb6b1fd) uses open.fe as an add-on to [OpenUI5 Framework]( https://github.com/SAP/openui5). Application developers can use the package open.fe to build applications based on SAP Fiori elements with OData V4 services. Applications that are based on the package open.fe can only consume the control libraries delivered as part of the OpenUI5 Framework. For more information about SAP Fiori elements, see [SAP Fiori elements](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/03265b0408e2432c9571d6b3feb6b1fd). Please note that some features, such as unified shell or navigation support, are restricted as they are used with the OpenUI5 Framework.

## Usage
You must maintain the dependency to the package @sap/open.fe package in the package.json, as it is not part of OpenUI5 framework. SAP Fiori elements recommends that you use the [UI5 Tooling]( https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling) to install the libraries that are part of the OpenUI5 framework.
