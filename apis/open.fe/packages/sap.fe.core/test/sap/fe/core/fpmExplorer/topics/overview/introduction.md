# Flexible Programming Model

SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 offers multiple ways to extend applications according to your specific requirements.
The flexible programming model provides a range of options for this, eliminating the need for a rigid choice between SAP Fiori elements and freestyle SAPUI5 development.
While you have the freedom to use any SAPUI5 coding or controls in extension points, you can also make use of our building blocks and controller extensions to enhance your application.
You can even create a custom app that runs on the SAP Fiori elements framework, where all pages are treated like custom pages.

# Flexible Programming Model Explorer

The flexible programming model explorer showcases the various ways you can extend Fiori elements applications and custom apps according to your specific needs.
It covers the publicly available scope of the flexible programming model and offers live samples that you can experiment with in a sandbox setup.
We've put together the most effective features for you below.

## Live Reload

You can adapt the sample code and will directly see how this looks in the app.
