## SAP Fiori elements Flexible Programming Model Explorer: ##sampleTitle## Playground Sample

This playground and learning sample application has been downloaded from the SAP Fiori elements Flexible Programming Model Explorer.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this sample is for demonstration purposes of SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 features only. Usage of SAP Fiori elements and OData annotations are based on best practices.\
However, the OData Service uses components such as the mock server, which are required for use in the Flexible Programming Model Explorer without a backend system.\
While this is fine for testing purposes, it is not suitable for production use.

### Starting the generated app

The sample runs locally on SAP [UI5 tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling), using the SAP Fiori [UI5 middleware for the Fiori elements mock server](https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-odata/tree/main/packages/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver).\
In order to launch the sample, simply run the following from the generated app root folder:

```
    npm install
    npm start
```

#### Pre-requisites:

Active NodeJS LTS (Long Term Support) version and associated supported NPM version. (See https://nodejs.org)
