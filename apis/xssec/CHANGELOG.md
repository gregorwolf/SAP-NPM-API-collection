# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 4.2.7 - 2024-11-08
- fix v3 compatibility layer to allow to configure new features like prooftoken validation there too
- fix service plan name handling

## 4.2.6 - 2024-10-17
- fix typescript definitions
- document and add a sample for  an automatic token exchange method

## 4.2.5 - 2024-10-16
- add TimeoutError Exception to provide a way to identify a timeout error

## 4.2.4 - 2024-09-05
- fix missing x-zid header in XSUAA token fetches via v3 compatibility requests with zoneId parameter
- add clientsecret as optional property to type XsuaaServiceCredentials

## 4.2.3 - 2024-09-03
- bugfix passport v3 wrapper so it does not call the error callback twice in specific scenario
- add certurl as optional property to type XsuaaServiceCredentials

## 4.2.2 - 2024-08-29
- export some more internal classes for better test support
- remove node-fetch dependency and use native https module instead

## 4.2.1 - 2024-07-25
- fix JWKS URL construction for XSA service bindings whose url contains already a path

## 4.2.0 - 2024-07-22
- move credential validation from Service constructors to fine-grained property validation upon use to support token fetches with partial credentials
- add type definitions for the configuration of the JWKS cache to the Service configuration
- include information about original http client error in both RequestError objects and debug log to allow analysis of the root cause of HTTP requests that cannot be sent

## 4.1.3 - 2024-06-27
- add zid as optional parameter to XsuaaService token fetch requests
- minor JsDoc fixes

## 4.1.2 - 2024-06-21
- fix for IdentityService token fetch requests: app_tid is now properly sent with the request

## 4.1.1 - 2024-06-19
- add new service configuration flag for JWKS cache: 'validation.jwks.shared' (boolean)
- use shared cache in v3 compatibility layer, otherwise compat layer has effectively NO caching as internally new Service instances are created for each request that each begin with an empty cache

## 4.1.0 - 2024-06-13
- Provide Typescript .d.ts typings
- Fix export of XssecPassportStrategyV3 in v3 package. Consumers that already adjusted their import to the "bugged" export structure of prior 4.0.X versions, should not be required to adjust their import again for this fix

## 4.0.4 - 2024-06-12
- MissingJwtError now inherits from ValidationError instead of ConfigurationError which implicitly changes its recommended statusCode from 500 to 401. Consumers are not expected to validate outside the lib whether requests contain a JWT before passing the request to the lib for validation. Encountering a MissingJwtError is therefore no longer classified as a misconfiguration of the library but as an expected error that may occur during validation.

## 4.0.3 - 2024-06-06
- export Token class and its subclasses

## 4.0.2 - 2024-06-05

- add Proof Token validation for SAP Identity Service tokens

- Fix IAS token exchange with X509 binding

## 3.3.3 - 2023-08-08

## 3.3.2 - 2023-07-28
- restore backward-compatibility feature: use cleanUpPemKey function on verification keys to support PEM with missing line breaks-

- fix error handling for cert endpoint

## 3.3.0 - 2023-07-24
- add app_tid to formular for token exchanges
- support for "x-app_tid" and "x-client-id" header for IAS cert endpoint
- bugfix for unknown variable in new cache implementation

## 3.2.18 - 2023-07-13
- Replaced keycache implementation with new JwksReplica implementation: When a JWKS is used for validation, it is now checked if the cached replica will expire soon (default refresh period: 15min before expiration). If so, it will be refreshed in the background and the cached replica will still be used for validation until it has expired completely (default expiration time: 30min since last refresh). Validation of incoming requests will only be blocked by an expired JWKS if it could not be refreshed during the refresh period. Only one call at a time will be performed to refresh the JWKS.
- Addd support for resource-attribute for token flow/token exchange calls
