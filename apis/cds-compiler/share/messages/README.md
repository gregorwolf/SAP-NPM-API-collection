# Message Explanations

This directory contains explanations for various compiler messages.  These
long-form texts aren’t limited to errors but can also explain info
messages or warnings.

## Structure of an Explanation file

All files are structured the same way:

1. Heading with message-id
2. Short description (one sentence, for example the compiler message's text)
3. Default severity (also mention when upgraded to error)
4. Erroneous code example
5. Explanation of the example  
   May also contain a longer explanation of the message.  Also explain why it
   is considered an error).
6. (only if possible) Description of a possible fix
7. Fixed code example
8. Related Messages

All markdown conventions of cds-compiler shall be applied to the explanation
files as well.

Furthermore:

- Do not use passive but directly address the user (that means "you")  
  Passive is a German thing.
- Use a column width of 80  
  If users open the message in a terminal, it is often 80 characters wide.
  Even if that was not the case, longer lines are harder to read, so keep them
  short.
