### Changed
- Visualize dependencies:
  + no longer need to install 3rd party extension
  + no longer need to show `.dot` text file first to render the graph i.e. less flickering

- `@sap/cds-compiler` 4.6.2


## Version 7.5.1 - 2024-01-19

### Fixed
- Retrieval of `@sap/cds-dk` global installation path is now more robust in SAP Business Application Studio

## Version 7.4.0 - 2023-11-16

### Changed
- Formatting
  + Projections now similar to that of views
  + Markdown formatting inside doc comments is now done with `marked` parser AST instead of `remark`.
    Previously, this was enabled by default but due to slightly different formatting this feature is
    disabled by default, now. Thus, already formatted markdown won't be changed and thus
    won't lead to file changes when used in CI/CD via `format-cds` command.
    Enable it via format setting `formatDocComments`.
- Simplified trace configuration - just use `cds.trace.level`

### Fixed
- Formatting
  + Padding of quoted identifiers
  + Treat only /** (no additional asterisks) as start of doc comments
- Syntax highlighting of comments within braced select item lists
- Update of diagnostic messages could have got lost

## Removed
- Workspace validation modes `OpenEditorsAndDirectSources` and
  `OpenEditorsDirectSourcesAndDirectDependencies` are no longer supported.
  In real-world models they led to high CPU usage and slow responsiveness.
  Any of these user setting values are now treated as `ActiveEditorOnly`
  if supported by IDE, else `OpenEditorsOnly`.

   Please use doc comments (`/** ... */`) instead. The quick fix to migrate from _@cds.doc_ to _doc comments_ is still in place,
   but is likely to be removed in near future.

- `cds preview` now opens a read-only editor to show the cds file preview.

### Components
- @sap/cds-lsp 5.4.0
- @sap/cds-compiler 2.11.0

## Version 4.3.0 - 2021-09-23

### Added

- doc comments are automatically aligned
- new command: Restart CDS Language Support

### Fixed

- certain localized elements were still indexed
- new i18n entry in properties file has corrupted existing last entry

## Version 4.2.0 - 2021-07-30

### Added

- validation mode _ActiveEditorOnly_ (new default).
  The new mode reduces number of compilations during editing and thus improves responsiveness.
- new command _Visualize CDS file dependencies_ to analyze using dependencies of CDS model files.
  Getting an overview of file dependencies can help to keep your project architecture clean.
  Requires the 3rd party extension _Graphviz (dot) language support for Visual Studio Code_ (joaompinto),
  which can be installed with a single click.

### Changed

- consume cds-lsp 5.2.0
- consume cds-compiler 2.5.0

## Version 4.1.1 - 2021-07-05

### Changed

- consume cds-lsp 5.1.1
- consume cds-compiler 2.4.4
- new performance relevant user settings
  + `cds.workspace.debounceFastChanges`:  skip intermediate compilations when typing - enabled by default
  + `cds.workspace.scanDependentModules`: skip scanning of node_modules - enabled by default, speeds up start-up time

    Note:
    - when using code completion for global identifiers (see `cds.completion.workspaceSymbols.minPrefixLength`) this option needs to be enabled
    - for code completion of import paths in `using` statements this option needs to be enabled
    - to include definitions from nodejs dependent modules in workspace symbols this option needs to be enabled


## Version 4.1.0 - 2021-06-22

### Note

This is a quality release focusing on performance for large models.
There are new user settings and some have changed their defaults.
Best performance is achieved with default settings,
except `cds.contributions.enablement.odata` which should be switched `off` to speed up compilation, unless feature is needed.

Additonal hints to increase performance:
- Within _SAP Business Application Studio_: close `CAP Data Models and Services` view. Otherwise, it will ask for all workspace symbols at every change.
- Settings: `Cds › Contributions › Enablement: Odata`: switch off as already mentioned above
- Settings: `Editor › Goto Location: Alternative Definition Command`: do not select `goToReferences`. Otherwise, being already on a definition will trigger find references which requires all dirty models to be recompiled.
- Settings: `Workbench › Editor › Limit: Enabled`: switch on
- Settings: `Workbench › Editor › Limit: Value`: lower the number. If open editors have `using` dependencies, a change in one editor will lead to a recompile of releated editors.
- Commands `Go to References` / `Find All References` will recompile all models that might have changed due to a change in a depending model. If there are index models it often means the complete workspace is being recompiled.
Until a further change, reference calculation is resonably fast.
- Command `Go to Symbol in Workspace` will recompile the complete workspace once, then it is reasonable fast
- Changing settings in `CDS` section will currently perform a complete workspace invalidation i.e. required indexes will lead to recompilations on-demand as described above
- Changing certain `cds.env` settings e.g. folder configurations will invalidate the workspace as well
