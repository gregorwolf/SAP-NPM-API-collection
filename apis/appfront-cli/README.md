### Global Flags

In addition to command specific arguments, the following global flags may be passed to CLI:

| Flag | Alias | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| --help | -h | Print general CLI or command specific help |
| --verbose | -v | Add tracing information to the output |
| --output FORMAT| -o FORMAT| Output format. FORMAT is one of `json` or `yaml`|
| --root | | Allow CLI to run with root user privileges |

## Configuration

#### AFCTL_CONFIG
The Application Frontend Command Line Interface creates and uses configuration file, which may be found in `$HOME/.afctl/config.yaml`. It includes multiple configuration profiles that allow to easily switch between various Application Frontend API servers and users. After successfull login, the configuration file also includes JWT (JSON Web Token) that is used to authenticate the calls of command line interface to Application Frontend service API server. To use configuration file different from default, set `AFCTL_CONFIG` environment variable
to file path of desired configuration file.

#### AFCTL_LOG_LEVEL
The Application Frontend Command Line Interface supports multiple log levels:
- `0` - no logs
- `1` - errors only
- `2` - errors and warnings
- `3` - errors, warnings and information messages
- `5` - verbose logs with all messages (useful for troubleshooting and development). 
The log level may be controlled by setting `AFCTL_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. The default value is `3`. If `--verbose` global flag is used, the log level is `5` (overrides the value set by environment variable).

#### AFCTL_ACTIVATE
By default, the Application Frontend service activates newly deployed application versions. 
The behavior may be changed by:
- `push` command `--activate` or `--no-activate` argument (for single command execution)
- `push` command `--config config.json` configuration, where config.json `'{"activateVersion":false}'` (for command execututions using this configuration file)
- `AFCTL_ACTIVATE` environment variable (for every command executions)

#### AFCTL_POLLING_MAX_ATTEMPTS
During deployment with `push` command, there is a polling of deployment status.
By default, there will be 120 attempts to fetch the deployment status. After the threshold
is reached, the `push` command will fail (while deployment itself may still be in progress).
To support long running deployments for large applications (>100Mb), it is possible to change
the maximum number of polling attempts with `AFCTL_POLLING_MAX_ATTEMPTS` environment variable.
The value must be positive integer.

#### AFCTL_POLLING_DELAY
During deployment with `push` command, there is a polling of deployment status.
By default, the delay between polling requests is 2 seconds (2000ms).
To set different delay, it is possible to set `AFCTL_POLLING_DELAY` environment variable.
The value must be positive integer (in milliseconds).

If multiple options are used, the command argument has a higher priority than
configuration file, and configuration file has higher priority than environment variable.

#### AFCTL_XSAPP_TEMPLATE
By default, the `init` command either uses the `xs-app.json` in the current working directory (if it exists) as template for the target `xs-app.json` or creates a brand new `xs-app.json`. To specify different path to the file that should serve as template for the target `xs-app.json`, the `AFCTL_XSAPP_TEMPLATE` environment variable may be set. The template file content should be valid JSON. The route to serve static content from Application Fronted service will be added to the template, if it's not already exist. All routes pointing to `html5-apps-repo-rt` service will be changed to point to `app-front` service instead.

#### AFCTL_MANIFEST_TEMPLATE
By default, the `init` command either uses the `manifest.json` in the current working directory (if it exists) as template for the target `manifest.json` or creates a brand new `manifest.json`. To specify different path to file that should serve as template for the target `manifest.json`, the `AFCTL_MANIFEST_TEMPLATE` environment variable may be set. The template file content should be valid JSON. The application name an version will be added to the template or will replace the relevant values, if they are already present in template.

#### AFCTL_SAVE_ZIP
By default, the `push` command creates ZIP of ZIPs in memory and deletes it, once command is finished.
To keep generated ZIP and save it to file system, the `AFCTL_SAVE_ZIP` environment variable may be set to any non-empy value.
In this case `apps.zip` will be saved to current working directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience unexpected behavior, the execution of command never ends, you see error messages or stack traces in the output - you can run any command with global `--verbose` or just `-v` at the end. This will print trace logs with detailed information about each step in the command execution.
