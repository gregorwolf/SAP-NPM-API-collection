[![tested with jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested_with-jest-99424f.svg?logo=jest)](https://github.com/facebook/jest)

HANA SQL Analyzer for Visual Studio Code is a brand new software that we are developing from the scratch to help users analyze the performance of HANA SQL queries. This repository will be the only single source for the development plan, code, development status, release information, downloadable package, analysis know-hows, and bug reporting.

## Why Another SQL Analysis Tool?

First of all, you might have a question why we are developing another tool in addtion to the existing PlanViz in Studio and SQL Analyzer in HANA Cockpit. Some answers are:

- Bascially it is to make developers happier (developer experience).
- With the deprecation of Studio, we couldn't bring new features anymore to PlanViz in Studio.
- New WebIDE (official name: [SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio)) is built on [Eclipse Theia](https://theia-ide.org/), which is based on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is based on [Electron.js](https://electronjs.org/) new cross platform to build web-based desktop apps, which is based on Google Chrome(actually [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/)) browser and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). So, VSCode extension app can be plugged into new WebIDE, which is aligned with new developer tooling strategy for both cloud and on-prem.
- PlanViz has been built in 2011, and it required big refactoring to accomodate multiple SQL engines. We decided to build from the scratch for this major change.

## Features

SQL Analyzer for Visual Studio Code is still under heavy development. Here are some highlighted features:

- Live connection support (Note: connection details will be stored in [SecretStorage](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_53#_secrets-api).)
- Load multiple PLV files and keep the history
- Visualize query plans in PLV into plan graph
- Quick analysis support
- Critical path visualization
- Bookmark and sharing (Note: Personal data can be anonymized and the comments can be deleted by users.)
- Recommendations
- SQL Plan Execution Monitor for real-time analysis
- Advanced UX
