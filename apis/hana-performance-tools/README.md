[![tested with jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested_with-jest-99424f.svg?logo=jest)](https://github.com/facebook/jest)

The SQL analyzer tool for SAP HANA is a performance analysis tool that helps developers visualize and understand SQL execution plans. Designed for query tuning and optimization, it offers detailed insights into how queries run within the SAP HANA database.

This extension replaces earlier tools like PlanViz in SAP HANA studio and the SQL analyzer in SAP HANA cockpit, delivering a more integrated and flexible experience directly in Visual Studio Code.

The GitHub repository is the central hub for development updates, release notes, downloads, usage guides, and issue tracking.
