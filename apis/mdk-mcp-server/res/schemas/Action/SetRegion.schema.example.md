## Action Result
Refer to the [MDK Guide](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/getting-started/mdk/development/action-binding-and-result.html#action-results) to understand what an action result is.

When this action gets executed successfully, the ActionResult is ideally the set region, otherwise itâ€™s an error message.
