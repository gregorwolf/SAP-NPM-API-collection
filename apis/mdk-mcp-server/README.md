# Welcome to @sap/mdk-mcp-server

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/sap/mdk-mcp-server)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/sap/mdk-mcp-server)


## What is MCP server for mobile development kit?
This open-source server provides AI agents with comprehensive MDK knowledge and tools. By combining best practice guidelines, project-aware context information, templates for creating new projects, and access to the MDK CLI tools, the MDK MCP server transforms AI agents into MDK development experts.

## What is mobile development kit?
The SAP Mobile Development Kit (MDK) is a powerful framework that enables developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using a metadata-driven approach. It is part of SAP Business Technology Platform and integrates tightly with SAP Mobile Services. 
Some of SAPâ€™s larger and complex mobile apps are built using MDK. An example is [SAP Service and Asset Manager](https://www.sap.com/sea/products/scm/asset-manager.html).

> [!NOTE]
> This MCP server is an early release version of the MDK. Right now it can only run properly on Mac, it will be on Windows soon. You may encounter bugs or unfinished features. We'd love your feedback to make it better! Please report issues or share suggestions via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/sap/mdk-mcp-server/issues).

## Setup

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

2. Install [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/).

    ```bash
    npm i -g yo@4.3.1
    ```

3. Install the MCP server for mobile development kit (MDK): 

    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/SAP/mdk-mcp-server.git 
    cd mdk-mcp-server 
    npm i --include=optional 
    npm i -g @sap/mdk-mcp-server@. 
    ```

4. Configure your MCP client (AI agent) to connect to the server. Configuration will vary depending on the AI agent used.

    **Cline in VS Code:** Example using the [Cline extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev). 
    
    - With Cline open, look below the prompt box and click **Manage MCP Servers**.
    - In the dialog, click **Settings**. The MCP Servers page opens.
    - Click **Configure MCP Servers**. This will open the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file in your editor.
    - In the JSON settings file, add a configuration block for MDK MCP server within a `mcpServers` section and save the file.

    ```
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "mdk-mcp": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "mdk-mcp",
          "args": []
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    > **Note:**  
    > If the MCP server does not listed with its available tools in the Cline extension immediately, restart VS Code.

    <details>
      <summary><b>Expand:</b> Usage in OpenCode</summary>

    Example using [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode):

    ```
    {
      "mcp": {
        "mdk-mcp": {
          "type": "local",
          "command": ["mdk-mcp"],
          "enabled": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><b>Expand:</b> Usage in Cursor</summary>

    Edit the file `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

    ```
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "mdk-mcp": {
          "command": "mdk-mcp",
          "args": []
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    </details>

    Once configured, your AI agent will have access to the MDK MCP server. Depending on your IDE settings, you may need to approve initial tool calls.

5. **Create a Rule File**: To ensure your AI coding assistant uses the MCP servers appropriately for your project, define rules and guidelines in a file named [`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md/). In the Cline extension for VS Code, click the **Manage Cline Rules & Workflows** icon below the prompt box, click **+** to create a new rule file (e.g., `AGENTS.md`) and add the above contents. 

    Example rules to guide agent behavior:

    ```markdown
    - Don't generate `.service.metadata` file.
    - Don't generate `.xml` file in the `Services` folder.
    - Don't change `.project.json` file.
    ```

6. Verify your LLM Provider and AI model.
 
    When you add Cline to VS Code, it uses Cline as the default API provider. You can choose a different LLM provider, such as SAP AI core.
    To add an SAP AI Core API provider in the Cline extension for VS Code, follow these steps:
      - With Cline open, look below the prompt box and click **Select Model / API Providers**.
      - Choose your API provider (such as SAP AI Core) and enter your details. See the instructions [here](https://docs.cline.bot/provider-config/sap-aicore#sap-ai-core) for detailed setup.
      - Select your preferred AI model.

7. **Integration with SAP Mobile Services:** For creating a new MDK application, the MCP server uses the Cloud Foundry CLI and a `.service.metadata` file containing:
    - The mobile application defined in the SAP Mobile Services instance. 
      - Mobile Services API Endpoint
      - Mobile Services App ID
    - Mobile Destinations including OData service metadata.

    We include a tool to help with creating or updating this file as part of our **VS Code extension: Mobile development kit extension for VS Code**. This is how you can use this tool to create or update the `.service.metadata` file:

      1.	Install the [Mobile development kit extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPSE.vsc-extension-mdk) version 1.32.0 or later.
      2.	Install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/download-and-install-cloud-foundry-command-line-interface).
      3.	Log in to your SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment. For more details you can refer to [this help documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/log-on-to-cloud-foundry-environment-using-cloud-foundry-command-line-interface).

          ```bash
          cf login <your target endpoint> --sso
          ```

      4. Create an empty folder on your machine and open it in VS Code.
      5. Open the Command Palette in VS Code and select **MDK: Open Mobile App Editor**.
      6. Create a new or select an existing mobile app.
      7. Select a destination.
      8. Click **Add App to Project**.

8. Your environment is now ready for the MDK development with MCP server. You can now enter a prompt to:

    - Generate a new MDK project displaying OData entities information.
    - Enhance an existing project adding additional UI controls on a given page.
    - Validate your current MDK project schema.
    - Migrate old MDK projects to latest schema.
    - Deploy your MDK project.
    - Generate onboarding QR code.
    - Explain specific properties. 
    - Find information about control properties or any aspect of the documentation.
