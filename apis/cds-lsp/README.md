# CDS Language Server

The CDS language server implements the Language Server Protocol ([LSP](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol))
for SAP's Core Data Services ([CDS](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl)).
It can be used in many popular IDEs like, for example, [Visual Studio Code](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/tools#vscode),
[IntelliJ](https://github.com/cap-js/cds-intellij),
or [Eclipse](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/tools#eclipse).
It provides many useful features for working with and enjoying CDS sources.

## Features

- Additional semantic highlighting

- Source code validation providing diagnostics (error messages, warnings, ...)

- Where-used navigation to
    - definition
    - references
    - highlight occurrences

- Code completion for
    - keywords
    - identifiers incl. not yet imported identifiers with corresponding `using` statement
    - using paths and artifacts incl. showing README.md documentation as details
    - i18n translation IDs
    - turn on/off formatting regions

- Snippets for typical CDS language construct<br/> (with documentation extracts of [capire](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl) explaining language concepts)<br/> like
    - namespace and context

- Quick fixes to
    - create using statement for unknown artifacts
    - maintain missing translation
    - convert `@description` annotations to doc comments

    - on save (depending on the IDE)
    - on paste (depending on the IDE)
    - with many options, configurable using
        - settings file
        - command line switches
        - Config UI with simulation of options for Visual Studio Code and Eclipse
        - JSON schema for textual support
    - also for markdown in doc comments

- Code formatting via CLI (incl. verification mode)

- Translation support
    - properties, JSON, and CSV files
    - navigate to translation definitions from translation IDs like `'{i18n>customerName}'`
    - show translations on hover
    - quickfix to maintain missing translations

- Annotation support via external plugin
    - diagnostics
    - where-used navigation
    - hover information
