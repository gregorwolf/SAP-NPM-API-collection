### Added
- Quick Fix to convert self-closing tags for `PropertyValue` and `LabeledElement`. You can now apply odata functions or annotate property values faster.
- Code completion and diagnostics for logical operators. You can now define values based on certain conditions more efficient.

## [1.1.2] - 2021-02-25

  - `odata.uriEncode`


## [1.0.28] - 2021-02-04

### Added
- Peek Definition for target path segments. You can now see where and how the annotated targets (entity types, properties, function imports, etc) are defined.
- Go To Definition for target path segments. You can now navigate to the place in the metadata where the annotated targets (entity types, properties, function imports, etc) are defined.
- Peek Definition for the dynamically created aggregared properties. You can now see how and where the property used as an annotation value is defined also if it is  dynamically created using the `Analytics.AggregatedProperties` annotation.
- Go To Definition for the dynamically created aggregared properties. You can now navigate to the place in the metadata or annotation file where the aggregated property is defined with the `Analytics.AggregatedProperties` annotation.


## [1.0.26] - 2021-01-21

### Added
- Peek References for annotations referenced in other annotations. You can now see if and where the annotation is referenced.
- Go To References for annotations referenced in other annotations. You can now navigate to the place in the project where the annotation is referenced (if any).
- Peek Definition for entity type properties and actions used in annotations. You can now see where the entity type property or action is defined.
- Go To Definition for entity type properties and actions used in annotations. You can now navigate to the place in the metadata where the entity type property or action is defined.
- Dedicated validation and quick fix for wrong case in annotation terms, properties, record types, paths and enum values. You can now fix the typos related to wrong case with one click. 
- Dedicated validation for type mismatch in paths. 

### Changed
- Omitted qualifier tab stops in code completion snippets for annotation not applied to entity type 
- Omitted attributes in code completion snippets for boolean type annotations with default value `true`.
