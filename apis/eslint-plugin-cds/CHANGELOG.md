## [3.1.2] - 2024-10-31

### Fixed

- run inferred rules correctly on Microsoft Windows


## [3.1.1] - 2024-10-08

### Changed

- `no-db-keywords` is no longer part of the 'recommended' rules,
  as the cds-compiler takes care of quoting SQL keywords, if they are used as identifiers.

### Fixed

- `auth-restrict-grant-service` can now handle invalid values for `@restrict`
- `auth-use-requires` now handles `null` values for `@restrict.grant.to`
- `auth-valid-restrict-to` is now more robust against invalid properties such as `__proto__`
  and reduces the number of false positives
- `auth-valid-restrict-where` now handles and reports invalid value `@restrict: [{where: null}]`
- `auth-no-empty-restrictions` now handles invalid value `@restrict: [null]`


## [3.1.0] - 2024-09-26

### Added

- api:
  + rules now have a `name` property, containing the rule name
  + new exported property `parser`
- rules: there is now an `experimental` rule group, containing new rules that can be tested
- new experimental rules were added:
  + `@sap/cds/sql-null-comparison`
  + `@sap/cds/no-java-keywords`
- `auth-valid-restrict-grant` now proposes '*' when incorrect `@restrict.grant` value 'any' is used

### Removed

- api: `genDocs` was removed

### Fixed

- cli: Running `eslint` on the command line now runs `inferred` rules again
- `start-entities-uppercase` no longer reports false positives for elements
- Typescript errors in `lib/types.d.ts` were fixed
- Rule property `hasSuggestions: true` was removed from rules that did not have suggestions
- Custom rule tests using `runRuleTester` did not catch errors in files inside `valid/`.
  Tests can now also be run with other test runners such as `mocha` and `node --test` instead of just `jest`
- `auth-` lint rules have been reworked to reduce the number of false positives and negatives
  + `auth-valid-restrict-where` no longer runs in quadratic time and now handles "expressions as annotation values"
  + `auth-no-empty-restrictions` now runs for actions and functions, too
  + `auth-use-requires` will not propose `@requires` anymore, if the `@restrict` has a `where` condition
  + `auth-valid-restrict-grants` incorrectly proposed to use `WRITE` instead of other events; it no longer crashes for invalid value types and now runs on all CSN artifacts
  + `auth-valid-restrict-keys` has improved reporting about misspelled vs unknown properties; it now runs on all CSN artifacts

## [3.0.5] - 2024-09-11
