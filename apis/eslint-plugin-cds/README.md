# @sap/eslint-plugin-cds


The [ESLint](https://eslint.org) plugin includes a set of recommended [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap) model and environment rules.	The aim of CDS linting is to catch issues with CDS models and with the environment early. To use this module we recommend to install [@sap/cds-dk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds-dk) globally.

See the [CDS Linting documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/tools/cds-lint/) for more details, or jump directly to a complete [list of rules](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/tools/cds-lint/#cds-lint-rules). CAP provides a set of recommended rules. On top, you can create your own, application-specific rules.
